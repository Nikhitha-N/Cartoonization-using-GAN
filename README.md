# 🎨 Cartoonisation – A Series of Illustrations

## 📌 Project Overview

**Cartoonisation** is a computer vision-based project designed to transform real-world images and videos into cartoon-style illustrations. Using **machine learning**, **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **TensorFlow**, the project aims to produce high-quality, colorful, and smooth cartoon representations of real-time visuals. The system simplifies the process of generating cartoons by leveraging **white-box cartoonization** models for enhanced clarity and precision.
